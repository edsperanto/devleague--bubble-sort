# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

### ELI5

Look at each number in a list and compare it to the number on its right.

If it is bigger than the number on its right, swap them.

Repeat this process until there are no more numbers to swap.

### Pseudocode

While not sorted

-- Loop through array

-- -- if number is bigger than number on its right

-- -- swap the two numbers
