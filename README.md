# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

### ELI5

Look at each number in a list and compare it to the number on its right.

If it is bigger than the number on its right, swap them.

Repeat this process until there are no more numbers to swap.

### Pseudocode

```
while not sorted
	loop through array
		if number is bigger than number on its right
		swap the two numbers 
```

### Performance

Best case scenario: O(n)

Worst case scenario: O(n^2)

## Insertion Sort

### ELI5

Look at each number in a list and compare it to the number on its left.

If it is smaller than the number on its left, swap them.

Repeat this process until there are no more numbers to swap.

### Pseudocode

```
loop through array
	while current number smaller than number on its left
		swap the two numbers
		compare with one more number to the left
```

### Performance

Best case scenario: O(n)

Worst case scenario: O(n^2)

## Selection Sort

### ELI5

Look for the smallest number in array.

When found, push number to end of sorted array.

Repeat until original array is empty.

### Pseudocode

```
prepare new array to put numbers in
find smallest number in original array until empty
	put smallest number at the end of new array
```

### Performance

Best case scenario: O(n^2)

Worst case scenario: O(n^2)

## Quick Sort

Find a number in array as divider.

Numbers smaller than divider will group to its left.

Numbers greater than divider will group to its right.

Repeat this process for these small groups until it is indivisible.

### ELI5

### Pseudocode

```
take 
```

### Performance

Best case scenario: O(n log n)

Worst case scenario: O(n^2)

## Merge Sort

### ELI5

Break array into smaller pieces until there is one number in each piece.

Sort and group each small piece one at a time.

Repeat until all small pieces are grouped back to size of original array.

### Pseudocode

### Performance

Best case scenario: O(n log n)

Worst case scenario: O(n log n)
