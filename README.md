# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

### ELI5

Look at each number in a list and compare it to the number on its right.

If it is bigger than the number on its right, swap them.

Repeat this process until there are no more numbers to swap.

### Pseudocode

```
while not sorted
	loop through array
		if number is bigger than number on its right
		swap the two numbers 
```

### Performance

Best case scenario: O(n)

Worst case scenario: O(n^2)

## Insertion Sort

### ELI5



### Pseudocode

```
loop through array
	while current number smaller than number on its left
		swap the two numbers
		compare with one more number to the left
```

### Performance

Best case scenario: O(n)

Worst case scenario: O(n^2)

## Selection Sort

### ELI5

### Pseudocode

```
prepare new array to put numbers in
find smallest number in original array until empty
	put smallest number at the end of new array
```

### Performance

Best case scenario: O(n^2)

Worst case scenario: O(n^2)

## Quick Sort

### ELI5

### Pseudocode

```
take 
```

### Performance

Best case scenario: O(n log n)

Worst case scenario: O(n^2)

## Merge Sort

### ELI5
